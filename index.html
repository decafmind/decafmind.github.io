            <p> Randy is a confessed-nerd and geek (they are different, mind you). Just how he loves to read books and write quotes, is how equally he loves to tinker on his computer and write codes. Although he is not a typical nerd who wear glasses and a typical geek who collect stuffs (he just yet can't afford), he surely behaves like them. Most of his free time were spend on experimenting on different computer operating system, he loves linux btw; reading technical books related to his field when he needs wisdom, and novels when he need inspirations; enrolling and taking online courses; bookmarking the best of the articles he found; learning different programming language, and sometimes toying with them; writing on his blog; or anything that get his interests. </p>
            <p>He finished his Bachelor Degree in a state-university: Quezon City Polytechnic University on year 2016. His degree is on Information Technology Major in Programming. Although he loves literature since he's young, he has yet found new love on Programming when he started College. He begin his journey on software development by helping people in their codes and by reading a lot of Programming Books. His favorite is The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journey Man to Master, by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. He then proceed to joining IT-competition and developing computer-system for real-life purposes to practice his skill. </p>
            <p> He is a polymath and believes on life-long learning. Learning random facts every now-and-then becomes one of his leisure -- like watching science and technoloy channels on Youtube, and reading different literatures. Though his choice of career is on Information Technology, he is secretly rooting on being an author. He loves reading the work of Lemony Snicket, Dan Brown, and David Levithan. His career idol is Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux and Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla Motors. </p>
            <p> He build this website as a proof-of-concept of his skills in Software Development, and to showcase it to his future-employer or future business-partner(s). This is made from ground using open-source technology: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JQuery, FontAwesome, and Google Fonts. </p>
            <p> Feel free to discover more about him by viewing his online CV and porfolio. Thanks for visiting! </p>
